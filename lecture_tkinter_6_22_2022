Graphical User Interface(GUI) is a form of user interface which allows users to interact with computers 
through visual indicators using items such as icons, menus, windows, etc. It has advantages over the Command 
Line Interface(CLI) where users interact with computers by writing commands using keyboard only and whose usage 
is more difficult than GUI.

What is Tkinter?
Tkinter is the inbuilt python module that is used to create GUI applications. It is one of the most 
commonly used modules for creating GUI applications in Python as it is simple and easy to work with. 
You donâ€™t need to worry about the installation of the Tkinter module separately 
as it comes with Python already. It gives an object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.

Some other Python Libraries available for creating our own GUI applications are
Kivy
Python Qt
wxPython
Among all Tkinter is most widely used

What are Widgets?
Widgets in Tkinter are the elements of GUI application which provides various controls (such as Labels, 
Buttons, ComboBoxes, CheckBoxes, MenuBars, RadioButtons and many more) to users to interact with the application.

#creating button
# import everything from tkinter module
from tkinter import *

# create a tkinter window
root = Tk()			

# Open window having dimension 100x100
root.geometry('100x100')

# Create a Button
btn = Button(root, text = 'Click me !', bd = '5',
						command = root.destroy)

# Set the position of button on the top of window.
btn.pack(side = 'top')

root.mainloop()

#label widgets
from tkinter import *


top = Tk()
top.geometry("450x300")
	
# the label for user_name
user_name = Label(top, text = "Username").place(x = 40, y = 60)
	
# the label for user_password
user_password = Label(top, text = "Password").place(x = 40, y = 100)
	
submit_button = Button(top, text = "Submit").place(x = 40, y = 130)
	
user_name_input_area = Entry(top, width = 30).place(x = 110, y = 60)
	
user_password_entry_area = Entry(top, width = 30).place(x = 110, y = 100)
	
top.mainloop()

######
Canvas widget
The Canvas widget lets us display various graphics on the application. It can
be used to draw simple shapes to complicated graphs. We can also display 
various kinds of custom widgets according to our needs.

from tkinter import *

root = Tk()

C = Canvas(root, bg="yellow",
		height=250, width=300)

line = C.create_line(108, 120,
					320, 40,
					fill="green")

arc = C.create_arc(180, 150, 80,
				210, start=0,
				extent=220,
				fill="red")

oval = C.create_oval(80, 30, 140,
					150,
					fill="blue")

C.pack()
mainloop()

from tkinter import *
import tkinter as tk

root = Tk()

# specify size of window.
root.geometry("250x170")

# Create text widget and specify size.
T = Text(root, height = 5, width = 52)

# Create label
l = Label(root, text = "Fact of the Day")
l.config(font =("Courier", 14))

Fact = """A man can be arrested in
Italy for wearing a skirt in public."""

# Create button for next text.
b1 = Button(root, text = "Next", )

# Create an Exit button.
b2 = Button(root, text = "Exit",
			command = root.destroy)

l.pack()
T.pack()
b1.pack()
b2.pack()

# Insert The Fact.
T.insert(tk.END, Fact)

tk.mainloop()
